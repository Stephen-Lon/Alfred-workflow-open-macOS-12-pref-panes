# Alfred-workflow-open-macOS-12-pref-panes
# Note 

This workflow has been tested on macOS 12.6 and is not guaranteed to work on other macOS versions. In particular note that it is very unlikely to work with the new `System Settings` in macOS Ventura when that is released (and has not been tested with beta versions of macOS Ventura).

# Usage

This workflow lists, in response to the user configurable `prefs` keyword, various macOS System Preference panes. When you select the relevant pane from the alphabetical, searchable list simply press <Enter> to display the pane.

I have chosen to keep the list of panes in alphabetical order—rather than allowing Alfred to sort them based on usage—as they seem to me easier to browse in that order. If you feel there are too many panes listed by all means delete from the list filter those you do not wish to see.

# Acknowledgment

See, generally, [How to open every macOS System Preferences Pane](https://github.com/bvp663/MacAdmin/blob/main/macos_preferencepanes.md)—to the author of which I am much indebted.
